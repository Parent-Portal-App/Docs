# Phonegap CLI

Phonegap is used to make mobile apps with HTML, CSS and JS.

## Requirments

There are a few simple requirements you'll need prior to installing the PhoneGap CLI:

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - a JavaScript runtime to build your JavaScript code
[git](http://git-scm.com/) - used in the background by the CLI to download assets. It comes pre-installed on some operating systems.

To see if you already have it installed, type `git` from the command line.
